# Birdnest-Solution ![CI/CD](https://github.com/Melimet/Birdnest-Solution/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Solution to reaktor 2022 summer code challenge
## Description
Monadikuikka images in frontend header were generated by [Dall-e](https://labs.openai.com/).
## Installation
Below are two different ways to run the project: through docker or shell scripts 
In order for the app to work, both ways require a postgreSQL db to be setup and configured to a environment file. [Here](https://www.codecademy.com/article/installing-and-using-postgresql-locally) is a guide to setup postgres locally. Alternatively postgres can be setup quite easily on a service such as [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/postgres/getting-started/create-pg-cluster/).


### Step 0 for both ways
0. Configure environment variables in `./backend/.env`. The environment file must be configured so that the app can connect to a postgresql database - Otherwise the app will not run. `./backend/` contains a `.env.pub` file which contains a model .env file with examples. `.env.pub` must be renamed to `.env`
When `.env` is configured, make sure to remove ## and all text after them. Also make sure no whitespace is present in the file.

### Docker
1. If you don't have docker installed, follow the [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Execute in console
```
docker build -t birdnest-solution-image .
docker run -p 3001:3001 -d --env-file ./backend/.env --name birdnest-solution-container birdnest-solution-image
```
3. The project can now be accessed in http://localhost:3001/. The docker image will be running in the backround, it can be shut down with
```
docker stop birdnest-solution-container 
docker rm birdnest-solution-container
```

### Shell scripts

1. Run these commands in project root folder. These commands install required dependencies and start the app.
```
sh scripts/install_dependencies.sh
sh scripts/build_and_copy_frontend.sh
sh scripts/start.sh
```
2. The project can now be accessed in http://localhost:3001/.

## Architecture

## Testing

## Improvements
- For better scalability, backend could be split in to two separate entities: A poller api that polls the provided apis and writes the pilot info into database and a simple express backend that responds to frontend's api requests.
